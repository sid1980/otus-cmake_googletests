# rapidcheck example2

Sometimes, we may just include the rapidcheck source, instead using a previously compiled (and maybe buggy) artifact.

Note: to get rapidcheck, here I provide get_rapidcheck.sh, which calls git command directly.
If you would like to put this step in CMake scripts, you may refer to "external_add_example" in this repo.
